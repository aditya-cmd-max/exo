      <h2>Blog #2 Concept</h2>
      <p>Asking the right question often leads us to the most profound answers. Throughout history, the most brilliant minds have dared to ask what others wouldn't. Whether it’s Einstein rethinking space-time or a child wondering why the sky is blue, questions are the first step toward innovation.</p>
      <p>Curiosity drives inquiry. Inquiry drives discovery. Discovery changes the world. Instead of passively accepting facts, genius minds question the status quo to uncover deeper truths and better solutions. By cultivating a questioning attitude, we unlock new perspectives that drive progress.</p>
      <p>So next time something intrigues you—don’t just observe. Ask. Because a single question might just lead to the breakthrough you seek.</p>
